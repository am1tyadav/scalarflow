# scalarflow

A Machine Learning library written in pure Python for educational purpose. It's very slow,
and almost completely useless for solving real problems, and should be used just to
understand and explore basic machine learning concepts.

Heavily inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and
_tries_ to implement a Keras-like API.
